# GCP-003: Program Manager Decision Document

## Work Item
GCP-003 — Enforce TDD and Builder Git Operations

## Decisions Made

### 1. Minimal Viable Changes
Only updating the specific sections needed. Not rewriting entire role files.

### 2. Clear Trigger Points for Builder
- "Before Developer" = after Tester completes, before Developer starts
- "After Documentor" = after Documentor completes, before marking Done

## Tradeoffs Accepted
- No automated enforcement (documentation-based only)
