# GCP-003: Tester Decision Document

## Work Item
GCP-003 — Enforce TDD and Builder Git Operations

## Decisions Made
- Manual verification via file inspection is appropriate for documentation changes
- 7 test cases cover all acceptance criteria

## No Automated Tests
This work item modifies documentation only. Automated tests would require parsing markdown, which is overkill.
