# GCP-001: Reviewer Decision Document

## Work Item
GCP-001 — Copy Golazo Copilot Instructions Locally

## Decisions Made

1. **Design approved without changes**
   - Design is clear, feasible, and well-scoped
   - No blocking issues identified

2. **Placeholder format recommendation provided**
   - Suggested consistent template for placeholder files
   - Left as implementation detail for Developer role

3. **No new User Stories required**
   - All observations are non-blocking
   - Future work items noted but not formally created (out of scope)

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Require formal placeholder spec before proceeding | Over-specification for simple task |
| Create future work items now | Out of scope for review role; can be done post-completion |

## Tradeoffs Accepted

- Placeholder format not strictly specified — allows Developer flexibility but could lead to inconsistency if not careful

## Known Limitations or Risks

- None new identified beyond what Design Doc already covers
