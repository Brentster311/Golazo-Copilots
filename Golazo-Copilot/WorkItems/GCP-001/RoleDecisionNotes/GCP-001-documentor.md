### Documentation Checks

- [x] User Story status updated to IMPLEMENTED
- [x] All role decision documents created
- [x] All acceptance criteria verifiable
- [x] No broken links (all file paths valid)
- [x] Artifact paths are relative to repo root

## Decisions Made

1. **All documentation complete**
   - Every role produced its required artifact
   - All paths follow Golazo conventions

2. **No README updates needed**
   - This work item creates foundational infrastructure
   - README can be updated in future work item if needed

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Create README explaining Golazo | Out of scope for GCP-001 |
| Add inline code comments | No code was written |

## Tradeoffs Accepted

- No user-facing documentation (README) for Golazo workflow yet
- Can be addressed in future work item

## Known Limitations or Risks

- New users may not know Golazo workflow exists without README documentation

## Next Steps
- Commit all changes to git
- Work item is ready for completion
