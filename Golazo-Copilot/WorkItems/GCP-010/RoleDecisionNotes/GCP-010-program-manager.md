# GCP-010: Program Manager Decision Document

## Work Item
GCP-010 — Role Transition Announcement

## Decisions Made

1. **Simple, single-location implementation**
   - Add subsection to spine only
   - No changes to role files needed

2. **Exact format from RC file**
   - Proven format, already validated
   - Three required elements: role names, reason, artifact

3. **Version bump to 1.1.3**
   - Patch version (backward compatible addition)

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Add to each role file | Duplicative, harder to maintain |
| Optional announcements | Defeats purpose of visibility |

## Next Role
Proceed to **Reviewer**.
