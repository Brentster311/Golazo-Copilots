## User Story

**Title**: Card Dealing and Initial Game Setup

**As a**: Player

**I want**: To start a new game with cards properly dealt and trump displayed

**So that**: I can begin playing California Jack with a valid game state

---

## Out of Scope

- Playing tricks (see CALJACK-003)
- Scoring (see CALJACK-004)
- Drawing from stock after tricks (see CALJACK-003)

---

## Assumptions

- **Assumption (explicit)**: Standard 52-card deck with no jokers
- **Assumption (explicit)**: Cards rendered programmatically (suit symbols + rank text)
- **Assumption (explicit)**: Player 1 is non-dealer, Player 2 is dealer

---

## Game Rules Reference

- Deal 6 cards to each player (opponent first)
- Remaining cards form face-up stock
- Top card of stock determines trump suit

---

## Acceptance Criteria (bulleted, testable)
