# Review Notes: CALJACK-001

**Work Item**: CALJACK-001 - Main Menu and Game Window Foundation  
**Reviewer**: Golazo Reviewer Role  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX

---

## Review Summary

**Verdict**: ? **Approved with minor observations**

The User Story and Design Doc are clear, well-scoped, and feasible. No changes to behavior, scope, or design are required. The state machine pattern is appropriate for this use case.

---

## Clarity and Completeness

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| User Story format | ? Pass | All required sections present |
| Acceptance Criteria | ? Pass | 5 items, all testable |
| Design Doc sections | ? Pass | All required sections present |
| Requirements traceability | ? Pass | FR-001 through FR-005 map to ACs |

---

## Feasibility and Sequencing

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Technology choice | ? Pass | Pygame appropriate for card game |
| Architecture | ? Pass | State machine is standard pattern |
| Rollout sequence | ? Pass | Logical order in rollout plan |
| Dependencies | ? Pass | Only pygame (external) |

---

## Risk Coverage

| Risk | Coverage | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Pygame installation | ? Covered | Mitigation: requirements.txt |
| Button click detection | ? Covered | Mitigation: Rect collision |
| Font rendering | ? Covered | Mitigation: default font fallback |

**Observation**: No risk identified for pygame initialization failure (e.g., no display). Consider adding try/catch with user-friendly error message.

---

## Operability and On-Call Impact

Not applicable for local game. ? Pass

---

## Edge Cases and Failure Modes

| Edge Case | Addressed? | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Window close (X button) | ? Yes | NFR-001 covers this |
| Rapid button clicks | ?? Minor | Not explicitly addressed, but state machine handles naturally |
| Window resize | ? N/A | Fixed size per assumption |
| Multiple instances | ?? Minor | Not addressed, acceptable for local game |

---

## Cost / Performance Tradeoffs

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 100ms response requirement | ? Reasonable | Pygame easily achieves this |
| Memory footprint | ? Acceptable | State machine minimal overhead |

---

## Naming Clarity

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| File names | ? Good | `menu_state.py`, `base_state.py` are clear |
| Module structure | ? Good | `game/states/`, `game/ui/` logical |
| Constants file | ? Good | Centralized configuration |

---

## Folder/Directory Structure

```
PythonApplication2/
??? main.py                 ? Clear entry point
??? requirements.txt        ? Standard location
??? game/
?   ??? __init__.py         ? Package marker
?   ??? constants.py        ? Centralized config
?   ??? states/             ? Logical grouping
?   ??? ui/                 ? Reusable components
```

**Verdict**: Structure is clean and follows Python conventions.

---

## Observations (Non-Blocking)

These are minor observations that do not require new User Stories:

1. **Pygame init error handling**: Consider wrapping `pygame.init()` in try/catch for graceful failure on systems without display capability.

2. **Game title**: The window title is not specified. **Suggestion**: Use "California Jack" as window caption.

3. **Placeholder state behavior**: Design Doc mentions placeholders but doesn't specify what they display. **Suggestion**: Show centered text like "Game Screen - Coming Soon" to aid testing.

---

## Changes Requiring New User Stories

**None identified.** 

All observations above are implementation details within the current scope and do not change behavior, scope, or design.

---

## Conclusion

The design is sound, appropriately scoped, and ready for Architect review. No blocking issues found.
