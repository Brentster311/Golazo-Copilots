## Observations (Non-Blocking)

1. **Debounce clicks**: Consider preventing rapid double-clicks that could play two cards
2. **Animation**: Brief card movement animation could improve UX (defer to future)
3. **Trick history**: Consider storing trick history for review (defer to future)

---

## Changes Requiring New User Stories

**None identified.**

All observations are implementation details or future enhancements.
