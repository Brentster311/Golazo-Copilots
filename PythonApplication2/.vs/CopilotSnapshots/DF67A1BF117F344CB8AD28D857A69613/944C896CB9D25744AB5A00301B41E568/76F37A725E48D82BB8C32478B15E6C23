# Role Decision Document: Project Owner Assistant

**Work Item**: CALJACK-001 - California Jack Card Game with GUI  
**Role**: Project Owner Assistant  
**Date**: 2025-01-XX

## Decisions Made

### 1. Work Item ID
- Assigned `CALJACK-001` as a descriptive identifier for this card game implementation

### 2. Scope Definition
- **Included**: 2-player local (hot-seat) gameplay, pygame GUI, score tracking, help screen with rules and attribution
- **Excluded**: AI opponent (deferred to next iteration), sound effects, save/load, network play

### 3. Rules Interpretation
- Used exact rules as provided by Project Owner (sourced from Bicycle Cards)
- No ambiguities identified in the rules

### 4. GUI Framework
- Selected **Pygame** per Project Owner's explicit request
- Rationale: Game-focused library, good for card games, cross-platform

### 5. Acceptance Criteria Structure
- Organized into logical groups: Setup, Gameplay, Scoring, UI, Help
- Each criterion is testable and maps to a specific feature

## Alternatives Considered

### GUI Framework
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Tkinter | Built-in, simple | Not ideal for games, limited graphics | Rejected |
| PyQt | Professional look, rich widgets | Heavy dependency, licensing | Rejected |
| **Pygame** | Game-focused, sprite support, active community | Requires install | **Selected** |

### Multiplayer Model
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Hot-seat** | Simple, no networking | Players see each other's moves | **Selected** |
| Split-screen | Both hands visible | Complex UI, spoils strategy | Rejected |
| Hidden hands | More realistic | Requires screen hiding mechanism | Deferred |

---

## Tradeoffs Accepted

1. **Hot-seat visibility**: In hot-seat mode, players can potentially see each other's cards during turn transitions. Accepted for simplicity; can add "pass device" screen in future.

2. **No card images**: Will use programmatically drawn cards rather than image assets. Reduces dependencies but may be less visually polished.

3. **Fixed window vs. responsive**: Leaning toward fixed/reasonable window size for simplicity in pygame.

---

## Known Limitations or Risks

1. **Turn transition**: No mechanism to hide hands between turns - players must trust each other or look away
2. **Pygame learning curve**: If team is unfamiliar with pygame, may need ramp-up time
3. **Card rendering**: Programmatic card drawing may be time-consuming to get right

## Open Questions (Resolved)

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Number of players? | 2 (per Project Owner) |
| GUI framework? | Pygame (per Project Owner) |
| AI opponent? | Deferred to next iteration (per Project Owner) |
| Sound effects? | No (per Project Owner) |
| Save/load? | No (per Project Owner) |
