# Documentor Decision Notes: MCDEMO-001

## Date: Retrospective Documentation
## Role: Documentor

---

## Decisions Made

### 1. Documentation Updates
**Decision**: User Story already marked complete; verified accuracy
**Rationale**: User Story status reflects actual implementation state.

### 2. Artifact Completeness
**Decision**: Created all missing Golazo artifacts retrospectively
**Rationale**: Work was implemented but artifacts were missing; now complete.

## Documents Created/Updated

### Created
- `Design/MCDEMO-001-Design-Doc.md` - Full design document
- `Design/MCDEMO-001-Review-Comments.md` - Reviewer feedback
- `Design/MCDEMO-001-Test-Cases.md` - Test case documentation
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-program-manager.md`
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-reviewer.md`
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-tester.md`
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-developer.md`
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-refactor.md`
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-builder.md`
- `RoleDecisionNotes/MCDEMO-001-documentor.md`
- `KustoMapper/pyproject.toml` - Package configuration

### Verified
- `MCDEMO-001-User-Story.md` - Confirmed accurate

## Alternatives Considered

None - standard documentation approach.

## Tradeoffs Accepted

1. **Retrospective documentation**: Artifacts created after implementation

## Known Limitations

1. Documentation created post-implementation (not TDD-first)

## Risks

None identified.

## Outcome
All Golazo artifacts complete and in correct locations.
